# Data Crawling in R

* This project is not based on something that we regulary do at IAZI.

* Inspiration: Last november, we had tried to extend the IAZI models on Indian data, particularly offeredPrice.IN. And among all the issues we faced, the most tedius and tiring was the data collection part. We had to search manullay to each object/appartment available online and then enter the values manually to the data tables.
task  was o prepare Indian model The tedious task of manually collecting data for the  Indian model preparation made us to search some better/smarter alternatives to collect data from online platforms.
